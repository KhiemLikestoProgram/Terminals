# Terminals
A new respitory for CLI applications (because GUI is too much for my brain to handle)

# About
Read my github page :)

# I'm too lazy but here's the languages:
- Python
- Batch (install run.bat) (from initial release to alpha-1.4.0)
> Reminder: Do not install this, this is not modified to know everyone's directories yet! (if you want to download this, search for a path in the program source code that doesn't exist on your computer, then add the folder at the path (or replace with your desire path).)

> **Note**: I'm quite busy with another project, so I'll stop this FOREVER :(
